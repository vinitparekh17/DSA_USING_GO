> Step 2: If array length is less than 2, return. <br/>
> Step 3: Move all the elements smaller than the pivot value to the left. <br/>
> Step 4: Move all the elements bigger than the pivot value to the right. <br/>
> Step 5: Repeat the process for the left half and the right half until the array is sorted. <br/>
