## Algorithms

1. What are algorithms?
- Algorithms are a set of instructions for accomplishing a task. Every piece of code could be called an algorithm.

2. Why are algorithms important?    
- Algorithms are important because they improve the efficiency of a program. They allow programmers to use the same set of instructions to perform a task repeatedly without having to write them from scratch every time.

3. What are the types of algorithms?
- There are two types of algorithms:
 - Sequential algorithms
 - Parallel algorithms

  1. What are sequential algorithms?
    - Sequential algorithms are algorithms that execute instructions one after another. They are also known as serial algorithms.

  2. What are parallel algorithms?
    - Parallel algorithms are algorithms that execute instructions simultaneously. They are also known as concurrent algorithms.

4. What are the characteristics of algorithms?
- The following are the characteristics of algorithms:

 - Unambiguous - Clear and precise
 - Input - Accepts input
 - Output - Produces output
 - Finiteness - Terminates after a finite number of steps
 - Feasibility - Can be implemented using the available resources
 - Independent - Does not depend on any other algorithm
 - Language-independent - Can be done in all lang.
  
5. What are the complexity measures of algorithms and Why do they matter?
   - The following are the complexity measures of algorithms:
     - Time complexity: Number of steps required to complete the algorithm.
     - Space complexity: Amount of memory required to complete the algorithm.
