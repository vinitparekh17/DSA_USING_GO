## Data Structures

1. What are data structures? 
- Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

2. Why are data structures important?
- Data structures are important because they allow us to store data in an efficient manner. They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.

3. What are the types of data structures?
- There are two types of data structures:
    - Primitive data structures
      - list
      - array
      - stack
      - queue
    - Non-primitive data structures

    1. What are primitive data structures?
     - Primitive data structures are the basic data structures that directly operate upon the machine instructions. They have different representations on different computers. They are used to develop fundamental data structures like lists, arrays, stacks, queues, etc.

    2. What are non-primitive data structures?
     - Non-primitive data structures are more complicated data structures and are derived from primitive data structures. They emphasize on structuring and storing a collection of data and also on the operations performed on them. Some examples of non-primitive data structures are:
        - linked list
        - tree
        - graph
        - hash table

4. What are the operations performed on data structures?
- The following are the operations performed on data structures:
    - Traversing
    - Searching
    - Insertion
    - Deletion
    - Sorting
    - Merging
